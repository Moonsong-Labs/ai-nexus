# Project Requirements

**Purpose:**
This project aims to implement a stack data structure in Rust for educational and personal enjoyment. It serves as a practical exercise to understand and apply fundamental data structure concepts in a systems programming language.

**Functionality:**
- Implement `push` operation to add elements to the stack.
- Implement `pop` operation to remove elements from the stack.
- Implement `is_empty` operation to check if the stack is empty.

**Problems Solved:**
- Provides a basic stack implementation for use in other projects or as a learning tool.
- Demonstrates how to manage data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.

**User Experience Goals:**
- The stack implementation should be easy to use and understand.
- The code should be well-documented and follow Rust coding conventions.
