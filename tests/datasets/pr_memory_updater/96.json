This addresses context loss in AI agents. The primary mechanism is `langmem`, providing semantic search capabilities over stored memories. `AgentGraph` can now automatically initialize and provide `SemanticMemory` and its tools to subclasses based on its configuration.\n 3.  **LangGraph Framework:** The primary framework used for building the AI agents, defining their state, and managing their execution flow.\n-4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools provided via `AgentGraph`/`SemanticMemory`, or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize` and `human_feedback`).\n+4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools provided via `AgentGraph`/`SemanticMemory`, or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize` and `human_feedback`, or Task Manager's file system tools).\n 5.  **System Prompts (REVISED):** Detailed system prompts define each agent's role, behavior, constraints, and interaction protocols. System prompts are now typically part of agent-specific `Configuration` classes (which subclass `AgentConfiguration`). These configurations (and thus the prompts) are accessed by the agent's graph logic (e.g., in custom `call_model` implementations, which now often receive the agent's full `Configuration` object directly as a parameter).\n 6.  **Configuration Management (REVISED):** Agents have configurable parameters, including LLM models, system prompts, and memory settings. This is managed via:\n     *   A `MemoryConfiguration` dataclass (`common.components.memory.MemoryConfiguration`) for memory-specific settings like `use_memory`, `load_static_memories`, and `user_id`.\n     *   A common `AgentConfiguration` in `src/common/configuration.py` (NEW, replaces `BaseConfiguration`), which includes a `memory: MemoryConfiguration` field. It also includes `user_id`, `model`, and `provider` for LangGraph.
