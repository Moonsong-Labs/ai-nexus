This addresses context loss in AI agents. The primary mechanism is `langmem`, providing semantic search capabilities over stored memories. `AgentGraph` can now automatically initialize and provide `SemanticMemory` and its tools to subclasses based on its configuration. The Tester agent, for instance, now includes logic to read from a `BaseStore` for contextual memories.\n 3.  **LangGraph Framework:** The primary framework used for building the AI agents, defining their state, and managing their execution flow.\n 4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools provided via `AgentGraph`/`SemanticMemory`, or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize` and `human_feedback`, or Task Manager's file system tools). The Tester agent's previous custom `upsert_memory` tool has been removed.\n-5.  **System Prompts (REVISED):** Detailed system prompts define each agent's role, behavior, constraints, and interaction protocols. System prompts are now typically part of agent-specific `Configuration` classes (which subclass `AgentConfiguration` or, in the case of the Tester agent, `common.config.BaseConfiguration`). These configurations (and thus the prompts) are accessed by the agent's graph logic (e.g., in custom `call_model` implementations, which now often receive the agent's full `Configuration` object directly as a parameter, or access it via `RunnableConfig`). The Tester agent features enhanced prompt management with workflow stage-specific prompts and dynamic prompt formatting.\n+5.  **System Prompts (REVISED):** Detailed system prompts define each agent's role, behavior, constraints, and interaction protocols.
