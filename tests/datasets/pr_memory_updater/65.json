This addresses context loss in AI agents. The primary mechanism is now `langmem`, providing semantic search capabilities over stored memories, replacing the previous conceptual Markdown-based \"Memory Bank\" and direct `upsert_memory` tool usage for agents based on the template.\n+2.  **Externalized Memory (Semantic Memory):** Agents rely on external storage for persistent knowledge, project state, and context. This addresses context loss in AI agents. The primary mechanism is now `langmem`, providing semantic search capabilities over stored memories. This is managed via the `SemanticMemory` component, typically initialized within the `AgentGraph` base class if `BaseConfiguration.memory.use_memory` is true. The `MemoryConfiguration` dataclass (`common.components.memory.MemoryConfiguration`) holds settings like `use_memory`, `load_static_memories`, and `user_id`.\n 3.  **LangGraph Framework:** The primary framework used for building the AI agents, defining their state, and managing their execution flow.\n-4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize` and `human_feedback`).\n-5.  **System Prompts:** Detailed system prompts define each agent's role, behavior, constraints, and interaction protocols.\n-6.  **Configuration Management:** Agents have configurable parameters, including LLM models, system prompts, and memory settings (e.g., `use_static_mem`). This is managed via:\n-    *   `Configuration` dataclasses from `agent_template`.\n-    *   A common `BaseConfiguration` in `src/common/config.py`.\n-    *   Agent-specific `Configuration` dataclasses (e.g., in `src/orchestrator/configuration.py`, `src/requirement_gatherer/configuration.py`) that subclass `BaseConfiguration`.\n+4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools provided by `SemanticMemory` or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize` and `human_feedback`).\n+5.  **System Prompts:** Detailed system prompts define each agent's role, behavior, constraints, and interaction protocols. These can be set in `BaseConfiguration.system_prompt`.\n+6.  **Configuration Management:** Agents have configurable parameters, including LLM models, system prompts, and memory settings. This is managed via:\n+    *   `MemoryConfiguration` dataclass in `common.components.memory.py` for memory-specific settings.\n+    *   A common `BaseConfiguration` in `src/common/config.py`, which now includes `system_prompt: Optional[str]` and `memory: MemoryConfiguration`.

Other agents like Requirement Gatherer might implement memory tools differently.\n-9.  **`AgentGraph` (NEW):** A common base class (`src/common/graph.py`) for defining agent graphs, promoting modularity. Used by Orchestrator and Requirement Gatherer. Its `__init__` method now takes `base_config: BaseConfiguration`.\n+8.  **`langmem` Integration:** Provides semantic memory capabilities (storage, search) for agents. The `SemanticMemory` component (`src/common/components/memory.py`) is initialized in `AgentGraph` if memory is enabled in the configuration. It uses `MemoryConfiguration` for its settings.\n+9.  **`AgentGraph` (NEW):** A common base class (`src/common/graph.py`) for defining agent graphs, promoting modularity. Used by Orchestrator, Requirement Gatherer, and now `AgentTemplateGraph`.\n+    *   Its `__init__` method now takes `base_config: BaseConfiguration` and initializes an optional `_memory: SemanticMemory` component if `base_config.memory.use_memory` is true, configured by `base_config.memory`.\n+    *   It provides a base `_create_call_model` method that uses `base_config.system_prompt`.\n \n \n ## 2. The Memory Bank System (Shift from Conceptual to `langmem`)\n \n The original \"Memory Bank\" concept described a system of structured Markdown files (`memory-bank/`) for agent knowledge persistence, particularly for the \"Cursor\" idea. This concept, detailed in `project_memories/global.md`, served as the initial design principle for externalized memory.\n \n-**Current Implementation (`langmem` and custom tools):** The project has integrated the `langmem` library to provide a more robust and queryable semantic memory system for agents based on the `agent_template`. These agents utilize `langmem` tools for storing and retrieving memories.\n-Other agents, like the Requirement Gatherer, now use custom tools (e.g., `memorize`) that might interact with the same underlying storage mechanism but are defined and invoked differently within their specific graph structure.\n-\n+**Current Implementation (`langmem` and custom tools):** The project has integrated the `langmem` library to provide a more robust and queryable semantic memory system. This is primarily managed by the `SemanticMemory` component, which can be automatically initialized and used by agents derived from `AgentGraph`.\n+*   **Configuration:** Memory behavior is controlled by the `MemoryConfiguration` dataclass (`common.components.memory.MemoryConfiguration`), which includes flags like `use_memory` (defaults to `False`) and `load_static_memories` (defaults to `True`), and `user_id`. This is typically accessed via `BaseConfiguration.memory`.\n *   **Storage:** Memories are stored in a `BaseStore` (e.g., `InMemoryStore` configured with embeddings like `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings`).\n-*   **Namespace:** Memories are typically namespaced by `(\"memories\", \"semantic\", user_id)` or `(\"memories\", \"static\", user_id)`.\n+*   **Namespace:** Memories are typically namespaced by `(\"memories\", \"semantic\", user_id)` or `(\"memories\", \"static\", user_id)`, where `user_id` comes from `MemoryConfiguration.user_id`.\n *   **Tools:**\n-    *   `agent_template` based agents: Use `langmem`-provided tools (`manage_memory`, `search_memory`) via `SemanticMemory`. A custom `memory_dump` tool is also available.\n-    *   Requirement Gatherer: Uses a custom `memorize` tool (defined in `src/requirement_gatherer/tools.py`, refactored from a previous `upsert_memory` function in the same file) for storing memories.\n-*   **Static Memories:** The concept of static, pre-loaded knowledge persists. JSON files in `.langgraph/static_memories/` can be loaded into the `BaseStore` under a static namespace if `use_static_mem` is enabled in the agent's configuration.\n-*   **Shift:** The shift moves from human-readable Markdown files as the primary memory source to a database/store queried semantically via tools. The core principle of externalized memory remains, but the implementation mechanism has evolved.
