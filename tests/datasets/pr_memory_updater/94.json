An initial focus is on an agent named \"Cursor\" which operates with a memory that resets between sessions, necessitating a robust external \"Memory Bank\" system for continuity. A specific rule (`.cursor/rules/read-project-memories.mdc`) now configures Cursor to always read all files within the `project_memories/` directory for every interaction, ensuring this core project context is consistently available to it. AI Nexus aims to be a platform for developing and managing such AI agents.\n \n **Key Concepts:**\n-1.  **Multi-Agent System:** The project involves a team of specialized AI agents (Orchestrator, Architect, Coder, Tester, Code Reviewer, Requirement Gatherer, Grumpy, Task Manager) working collaboratively.\n+1.  **Multi-Agent System:** The project involves a team of specialized AI agents (Orchestrator, Architect (NEW), Coder, Tester, Code Reviewer, Requirement Gatherer, Grumpy, Task Manager) working collaboratively.\n 2.  **Externalized Memory (Semantic Memory):** Agents rely on external storage for persistent knowledge, project state, and context. This addresses context loss in AI agents. The primary mechanism is `langmem`, providing semantic search capabilities over stored memories. `AgentGraph` can now automatically initialize and provide `SemanticMemory` and its tools to subclasses based on its configuration. The Tester agent, for instance, now includes logic to read from a `BaseStore` for contextual memories.\n 3.  **LangGraph Framework:** The primary framework used for building the AI agents, defining their state, and managing their execution flow.\n-4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools provided via `AgentGraph`/`SemanticMemory`, or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize` and `human_feedback`, or Task Manager's file system tools). The Tester agent's previous custom `upsert_memory` tool has been removed. The Code Reviewer agent can now use GitHub tools like `get_pull_request_diff` and `create_pull_request_review` to interact with pull requests.\n-5.  **System Prompts (REVISED):** Detailed system prompts define each agent's role, behavior, constraints, and interaction protocols. System prompts are now typically part of agent-specific `Configuration` classes (which subclass `AgentConfiguration` or, in the case of the Tester agent, `common.configuration.AgentConfiguration`). These configurations (and thus the prompts) are accessed by the agent's graph logic (e.g., in custom `call_model` implementations, which now often receive the agent's full `Configuration` object directly as a parameter, or access it via `RunnableConfig`). The Tester agent features enhanced prompt management with workflow stage-specific prompts and dynamic prompt formatting. The Code Reviewer agent has a specific `PR_REVIEW_PROMPT` for GitHub interactions.\n+4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools provided via `AgentGraph`/`SemanticMemory`, or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize` and `human_feedback`, or Task Manager's file system tools, or the Architect agent's (NEW) `memorize`, `recall`, `read_file`, `create_file`, and `list_files` tools).

The Code Reviewer agent has a specific `PR_REVIEW_PROMPT` for GitHub interactions. The Architect agent (NEW) has a detailed system prompt defined in its `prompts.py` and referenced in its `Configuration`.\n 6.  **Configuration Management (REVISED):** Agents have configurable parameters, including LLM models, system prompts, and memory settings. This is managed via:\n     *   A `MemoryConfiguration` dataclass (`common.components.memory.MemoryConfiguration`) for memory-specific settings like `use_memory`, `load_static_memories`, and `user_id`.\n     *   A common `AgentConfiguration` in `src/common/configuration.py` (NEW, replaces `BaseConfiguration`), which includes a `memory: MemoryConfiguration` field. It also includes `user_id`, `model`, and `provider` for LangGraph. Agent-specific system prompts are defined in subclasses.\n-    *   Agent-specific `Configuration` dataclasses (e.g., in `src/orchestrator/configuration.py`, `src/requirement_gatherer/configuration.py`, `src/agent_template/configuration.py`, `src/task_manager/configuration.py`) that subclass `AgentConfiguration` and can include their own `system_prompt` or other specific settings.\n+    *   Agent-specific `Configuration` dataclasses (e.g., in `src/orchestrator/configuration.py`, `src/requirement_gatherer/configuration.py`, `src/agent_template/configuration.py`, `src/task_manager/configuration.py`, `src/architect/configuration.py` (NEW)) that subclass `AgentConfiguration` and can include their own `system_prompt` (or agent-specific prompt fields like `architect_system_prompt`) or other specific settings.\n     *   The Tester agent's configuration (`src/tester/configuration.py`) now subclasses `common.configuration.AgentConfiguration` (aligning it with other refactored agents) and defines its `system_prompt`. Model and other common settings are inherited from `AgentConfiguration`.\n     *   The Code Reviewer agent's configuration is managed via a `CodeReviewerInstanceConfig` dataclass within its `graph.py` module, which holds `name`, `system_prompt`, and `github_tools`.
