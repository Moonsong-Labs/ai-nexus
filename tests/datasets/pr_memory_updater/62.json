This addresses context loss in AI agents. The primary mechanism is now `langmem`, providing semantic search capabilities over stored memories, replacing the previous conceptual Markdown-based \"Memory Bank\" and direct `upsert_memory` tool usage for agents based on the template.\n 3.  **LangGraph Framework:** The primary framework used for building the AI agents, defining their state, and managing their execution flow.\n-4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize` and `human_feedback`).\n+4.  **Tool-Using Agents:** Agents are equipped with tools to perform actions, interact with systems (like GitHub), and manage their memory (using `langmem` tools or custom tools like `file_dump`, or agent-specific tools like the Requirement Gatherer's `memorize`, `human_feedback`, and `summarize`).\n 5.  **System Prompts:** Detailed system prompts define each agent's role, behavior, constraints, and interaction protocols.\n-6.  **Configuration Management:** Agents have configurable parameters, including LLM models, system prompts, and memory settings (e.g., `use_static_mem`), managed via `Configuration` dataclasses (either from `agent_template` or the new common `src/common/config.py`).\n+6.  **Configuration Management:** Agents have configurable parameters, including LLM models, system prompts, and memory settings. Common settings are managed via `BaseConfiguration` (`src/common/config.py`), with agent-specific configurations (e.g., `src/orchestrator/configuration.py`, `src/requirement_gatherer/configuration.py`) subclassing it. `agent_template` also has its `Configuration` dataclass. Orchestrator uses an `AgentsConfig` dataclass to manage configurations for the agents it delegates to (e.g., enabling stubs, human-in-the-loop for Requirement Gatherer).\n 7.  **Asynchronous Operations:** The system heavily utilizes `async` and `await` for non-blocking operations within the agent graphs.\n 8.  **`langmem` Integration:** Provides semantic memory capabilities (storage, search) for agents, typically managed via the `Agent` class and `SemanticMemory` component for agents following the `agent_template`. Other agents like Requirement Gatherer might implement memory tools differently.\n-9.  **`AgentGraph` (NEW):** A common base class (`src/common/graph.py`) for defining agent graphs, promoting modularity.

The Memory Bank System (Shift from Conceptual to `langmem`)\n@@ -23,13 +23,16 @@\n The original \"Memory Bank\" concept described a system of structured Markdown files (`memory-bank/`) for agent knowledge persistence, particularly for the \"Cursor\" idea. This concept, detailed in `project_memories/global.md`, served as the initial design principle for externalized memory.\n \n **Current Implementation (`langmem` and custom tools):** The project has integrated the `langmem` library to provide a more robust and queryable semantic memory system for agents based on the `agent_template`.

The core principle of externalized memory remains, but the implementation mechanism has evolved.
