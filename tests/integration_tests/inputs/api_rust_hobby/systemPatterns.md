# System Patterns

**System Architecture:**
The system will be implemented as a single module in Rust. The stack will be implemented using a `struct` with a `Vec` (vector) to store the elements. This provides dynamic resizing capabilities.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Using `Vec` as the underlying data structure for the stack due to its simplicity and efficiency in most use cases.
- Implementing the stack as a generic type to allow storing elements of any type.

**Design Patterns:**
- Using the struct pattern to define the stack data structure.

**Component Relationships:**
- The stack struct will contain a single component: a `Vec` of generic type `T`.

**Critical Implementation Paths:**
- The `push` operation will append elements to the end of the `Vec`.
- The `pop` operation will remove elements from the end of the `Vec`.
- The `is_empty` operation will check if the `Vec` is empty.
