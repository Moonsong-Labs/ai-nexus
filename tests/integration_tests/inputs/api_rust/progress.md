# Project Progress: Simple Rust API with Hello World Endpoint

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Planning and Architecture Design
**Overall Progress**: 0% (Implementation not yet started)
**Last Updated**: May 8, 2025

## What Works
As this project is in the initial planning phase, no implementation has been completed yet. The following planning artifacts have been created:

- Project brief defining core goals and constraints
- Detailed project requirements
- System architecture and patterns documentation
- Technical context and technology selections
- Feature, testing, and security context documentation

## What's Left to Build

### Core Implementation (Priority: High)
- [ ] Project scaffolding and directory structure
- [ ] Cargo.toml with dependencies
- [ ] Basic server setup with Actix Web
- [ ] Hello World endpoint implementation
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Logging setup

### Testing (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Unit test framework setup
- [ ] Integration tests for the endpoint
- [ ] Test documentation

### Documentation (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Setup and usage instructions in README
- [ ] Code comments and documentation

### Security (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Security headers implementation
- [ ] Basic rate limiting
- [ ] Input validation

### CI/CD (Priority: Low)
- [ ] GitHub Actions or similar CI setup
- [ ] Automated testing configuration
- [ ] Deployment documentation

## Known Issues
No implementation issues yet as the project is in planning phase.

### Potential Challenges
1. **Dependency Selection**: Choosing the right versions of dependencies that work well together
2. **Configuration Management**: Balancing simplicity with flexibility for different environments
3. **Testing Async Code**: Setting up proper testing for async Rust code

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Web Framework Selection
- Initial consideration included Rocket, Actix Web, Warp, and Axum
- Decision made to use Actix Web due to its maturity, performance, and documentation
- This decision will be revisited if implementation reveals any issues

### API Design
- Decided to implement endpoints at both root (`/`) and `/hello` paths
- Will support both plain text (default) and JSON responses based on Accept headers
- This approach balances simplicity with demonstrating proper API design principles

### Project Structure
- Opted for a modular approach with separate files for different concerns
- This structure may seem over-engineered for a simple endpoint but establishes good patterns for extension

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Create project scaffolding with Cargo
2. Set up basic Actix Web server
3. Implement Hello World endpoint
4. Add basic tests
5. Document usage in README

## Blockers
No blockers currently identified.

## Team Coordination
This project is currently being architected. Implementation will be coordinated with development teams once the architecture is approved.

## Lessons Learned
As the project is in the planning phase, implementation lessons are yet to be documented. Initial architectural insights include:

- Even for a simple API, establishing clear patterns and documentation from the start is valuable
- Rust's ecosystem offers several good options for web API development
- Balancing simplicity with best practices is key for educational/template projects

This document will be regularly updated as implementation progresses.
