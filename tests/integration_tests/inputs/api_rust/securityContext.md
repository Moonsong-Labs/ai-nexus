# Security Context: Simple Rust API with Hello World Endpoint

## Current Work Focus
The current security focus is on establishing fundamental security practices for the Rust Hello World API, ensuring that even this simple application follows security best practices. This includes:

1. Implementing basic security headers
2. Setting up proper request validation
3. Configuring secure server defaults
4. Establishing a security-conscious development workflow

## Recent Changes
As this is a new project, there are no recent changes to document. The initial security implementation will establish the baseline approach.

## Next Steps
The following security activities are planned:

1. **Security Headers Implementation**
   - Add standard security headers to all responses
   - Configure Content-Security-Policy appropriately
   - Implement X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.

2. **Input Validation**
   - Implement validation for any request parameters
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Set appropriate size limits on requests

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Configure appropriate limits based on expected usage patterns
   - Add proper response headers for rate limit information

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement security-relevant logging
   - Ensure no sensitive information is logged
   - Set up monitoring for suspicious activity

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Establish process for keeping dependencies updated
   - Configure automated vulnerability scanning
   - Document dependency review process

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Security Headers Strategy
Options being considered:
- Minimal set of headers for simplicity
- Comprehensive set of headers for best practice
- Framework-provided defaults with customization

Current decision: Implement a comprehensive set of security headers as best practice, even for this simple API.

### Rate Limiting Approach
Considering:
- In-memory rate limiting (simplest)
- Redis-backed rate limiting (more scalable)
- No rate limiting (minimal approach)

Current decision: Implement simple in-memory rate limiting as a demonstration of the concept, with notes on how to extend to more robust solutions.

### TLS Implementation
Options:
- No TLS for development simplicity
- Self-signed certificates for development
- Let's Encrypt integration for production

Current decision: Document TLS setup as a deployment consideration but make it optional for development environments.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Security-First Development
- Consider security implications from the beginning
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement defense in depth where appropriate

### Secure Configuration
- No hardcoded secrets
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure defaults with explicit overrides

### Error Handling
- Security-conscious error messages (no leaking of sensitive information)
- Consistent error handling for security-related issues
- Appropriate logging of security events

## Learnings and Project Insights

As this is a new project, specific security learnings will be documented as development progresses. Initial insights include:

- Rust's memory safety features eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities
- Even simple APIs benefit from security best practices
- Security headers are a low-effort, high-impact security improvement

### Security Advantages of Rust
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Strong type system prevents many common vulnerabilities
- Ownership model eliminates data races
- Pattern matching ensures comprehensive error handling

### Security Considerations Specific to Web APIs
- CORS configuration needs careful consideration
- Rate limiting is essential even for simple APIs
- Input validation remains critical despite Rust's safety features

This document will be updated as the project evolves to reflect new security approaches, learnings, and changing priorities.
