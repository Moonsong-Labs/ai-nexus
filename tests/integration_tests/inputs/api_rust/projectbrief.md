# Project Brief: Simple Rust API with Hello World Endpoint

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple API in Rust that provides a single GET endpoint returning "Hello World". The API will serve as a demonstration of Rust's capabilities for building web services and provide a foundation for more complex API development in the future.

## Core Goals
1. Create a Rust-based API with a single GET endpoint
2. Return "Hello World" response from the endpoint
3. Implement proper HTTP status codes and response formatting
4. Ensure the API follows RESTful principles
5. Develop a solution that is lightweight and easy to deploy

## Target Users
- Developers learning Rust for web development
- Teams evaluating Rust for API development
- Projects requiring a simple, high-performance API template

## Success Criteria
- The API correctly responds to GET requests with "Hello World"
- The implementation follows Rust best practices
- The system operates with minimal resource usage
- The code is well-documented and maintainable
- The solution can be easily extended for more complex endpoints in the future

## Constraints
- The initial version will focus on a single endpoint functionality
- The API will be developed in Rust to leverage its performance and safety features
- The solution should be designed to run on standard server environments

## Timeline
- Initial architecture and design: 1-2 days
- Core functionality implementation: 1-2 days
- Testing and refinement: 1 day
- Documentation and deployment: 1 day

This brief serves as the foundation for the project and will guide all subsequent development decisions and activities.
