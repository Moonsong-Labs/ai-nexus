A project usually involves the following stages:

1. Gather requirements
2. Architect the design
3. Code and implement the design
4. Test the code
5. Review the code

These steps can be invoked from any other step in any stage of a product design. The code, test and review steps may form multiple cycles. 

IMPORTANT: If memory updated is requested in between these steps, then ALWAYS prioritize updating memory.
