# Project Requirements: Simple Rust API with Hello World Endpoint

## Why This Project Exists
This project addresses the need for a straightforward, performant API implementation in Rust. It serves as both a learning resource for developers new to Rust web development and a template for more complex API projects. In an ecosystem where many examples are either too complex or too simplistic, this project aims to provide a well-structured yet minimal implementation that follows best practices.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Learning Curve**: Provides a clear, focused example for developers learning Rust web development
2. **Boilerplate Reduction**: Offers a minimal but complete foundation that can be extended for real-world applications
3. **Performance Demonstration**: Showcases Rust's capabilities for building high-performance web services
4. **Best Practices**: Demonstrates proper API design, error handling, and project structure in Rust

## How It Should Work
1. **Request Handling**:
   - Accept HTTP GET requests at a defined endpoint
   - Process the request according to RESTful principles
   - Validate any request parameters (though minimal for this project)

2. **Response Generation**:
   - Generate a simple "Hello World" response
   - Format the response as appropriate (JSON, plain text, or both as options)
   - Include proper HTTP status codes and headers

3. **Server Configuration**:
   - Configure the server to listen on a specified port
   - Handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently
   - Implement proper request timeouts and error handling

4. **Interaction Flow**:
   - Client sends a GET request to the defined endpoint
   - Server processes the request
   - Server returns "Hello World" response with appropriate status code
   - Server remains ready for subsequent requests

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Developers should be able to understand the entire codebase quickly
2. **Responsiveness**: The API should respond to requests with minimal latency
3. **Reliability**: The server should handle errors gracefully and remain stable
4. **Clarity**: The API behavior should be predictable and well-documented
5. **Extensibility**: The structure should make it clear how to add additional endpoints or features

## Technical Requirements
1. **Rust-Based Implementation**: Utilize current stable Rust (1.70+)
2. **Web Framework**: Use a suitable Rust web framework (e.g., Actix, Rocket, Warp, or Axum)
3. **RESTful Design**: Follow REST principles for the API design
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling patterns
5. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for setup, usage, and extension
6. **Testing**: Include unit and integration tests to ensure reliability

## Constraints and Limitations
1. Initial version will focus on a single GET endpoint only
2. The project will prioritize clarity and best practices over advanced features
3. Performance optimizations will be limited to those that don't obscure the code's readability
4. The implementation will target standard server environments rather than specialized deployments

These requirements will guide the development process and serve as criteria for evaluating the success of the project.
