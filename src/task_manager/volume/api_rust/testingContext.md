# Testing Context: Simple Rust API with Hello World Endpoint

## Current Work Focus
The current testing focus is on establishing a comprehensive testing strategy for the Rust Hello World API, ensuring that even this simple application follows best practices for quality assurance. This includes:

1. Setting up the testing infrastructure and tooling
2. Defining test categories and coverage goals
3. Implementing initial tests for the core functionality
4. Establishing CI/CD integration for automated testing

## Recent Changes
As this is a new project, there are no recent changes to document. The initial testing implementation will establish the baseline approach.

## Next Steps
The following testing activities are planned:

1. **Unit Testing Setup**
   - Create test modules for each source code module
   - Implement unit tests for the hello world handler
   - Set up mocking for any dependencies

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Implement tests that start the server and make actual HTTP requests
   - Verify correct response status, headers, and body content
   - Test different request scenarios (various Accept headers, etc.)

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Establish baseline performance metrics
   - Implement simple load tests to verify the API can handle expected traffic
   - Document performance characteristics

4. **Documentation Testing**
   - Ensure code examples in documentation are correct and tested
   - Verify API documentation matches actual implementation

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure automated testing on pull requests
   - Implement test coverage reporting

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Test Framework Selection
Options being considered:
- Standard Rust test framework (simplest approach)
- Additional test crates like `proptest` for property-based testing
- External tools for API testing

Current decision: Start with the standard Rust test framework for simplicity, with integration tests using `actix-rt` for runtime testing.

### Test Coverage Goals
Considering:
- 100% coverage for core functionality
- Pragmatic approach focusing on critical paths
- Balance between test coverage and development speed

Current decision: Aim for high coverage (90%+) of core functionality, with particular attention to error handling paths.

### Test Organization
Options:
- Tests alongside implementation code
- Separate test directory structure
- Hybrid approach

Current decision: Use a hybrid approach with unit tests alongside implementation code and integration tests in a separate `tests` directory.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Testing Patterns
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for test structure
- Table-driven tests for multiple similar test cases
- Descriptive test names that explain the test's purpose
- Isolation between tests to prevent interdependencies

### Test Data Management
- Fixed test data for deterministic tests
- Generated test data for edge cases
- Clear separation between test setup and assertions

### Error Testing
- Explicit tests for error conditions
- Verification of error messages and types
- Coverage of all error handling paths

## Learnings and Project Insights

As this is a new project, specific testing learnings will be documented as development progresses. Initial insights include:

- Even for a simple API, comprehensive testing establishes good practices
- Rust's type system reduces the need for certain types of tests common in other languages
- Integration testing is particularly important for APIs to verify the complete request/response cycle

### Testing Challenges in Rust
- Mocking can be more complex in Rust compared to some other languages
- Async testing requires special consideration with the async runtime
- Balancing compile-time checks with runtime tests

This document will be updated as the project evolves to reflect new testing approaches, learnings, and changing priorities.
