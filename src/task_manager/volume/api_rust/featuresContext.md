# Features Context: Simple Rust API with Hello World Endpoint

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on implementing a minimal but well-structured Rust API that serves a "Hello World" response from a GET endpoint. This includes:

1. Setting up the basic Actix Web server infrastructure
2. Implementing the Hello World endpoint with proper response formatting
3. Ensuring the API follows RESTful principles and best practices
4. Establishing a solid foundation for future extension

## Recent Changes
As this is a new project, there are no recent changes to document. The initial implementation will establish the baseline functionality.

## Next Steps
The following features and enhancements are planned for implementation:

1. **Core Endpoint Implementation**
   - Create the basic GET endpoint at `/hello` or `/` that returns "Hello World"
   - Implement proper status code (200 OK) and content-type headers
   - Add basic request logging

2. **Response Format Options**
   - Add support for returning the response in different formats (plain text by default, JSON as an option)
   - Implement content negotiation based on Accept headers

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Set up environment-based configuration for port, host, etc.
   - Create a configuration module that loads from environment variables

4. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Include usage examples in the README

5. **Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for the handler function
   - Add integration tests that verify the API response

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Response Format
We are considering whether to:
- Return plain text only (simplest approach)
- Return JSON by default (more typical for APIs)
- Support both formats based on Accept headers (most flexible but adds complexity)

Current decision: Implement plain text by default with optional JSON support to demonstrate content negotiation while keeping the core simple.

### Endpoint Path
Options being considered:
- Root path (`/`): Simplest and most accessible
- `/hello`: More descriptive of the endpoint's purpose
- `/api/hello`: Follows convention for API namespacing

Current decision: Implement at both root (`/`) and `/hello` paths to demonstrate routing capabilities.

### Error Handling Strategy
Considering:
- Minimal error handling (appropriate for the simplicity of the project)
- Comprehensive error handling framework (better for extension)

Current decision: Implement a basic but extensible error handling approach that can be built upon later.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Separate modules for different concerns (routes, handlers, config)
- Clear separation between application setup and business logic
- Consistent error handling patterns throughout

### API Design
- RESTful principles
- Clear, consistent naming conventions
- Appropriate status codes and headers
- Self-documenting endpoints

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Test-driven development where appropriate

## Learnings and Project Insights

As this is a new project, specific learnings will be documented as development progresses. Initial insights include:

- Actix Web provides a good balance of performance and ergonomics for Rust web development
- Even for a simple API, establishing good patterns early pays dividends for future extension
- Rust's type system and error handling can be leveraged to create robust APIs with minimal boilerplate

This document will be updated as the project evolves to reflect new learnings and changing priorities.
